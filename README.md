  </p>


 ##  Introduction
A simple template based video generator project written in Python. The project can be used to create videos like those of the popular Hacking group "Anonymous". We have a built-in video script editor to create your own custom video, which will be played on the screen. This works on various Python Libraries and Audio Post Processors like FFMPEG

### InShort
It is an Anonymous Video Generator with which you can Build viral and shareable videos, complete with audio narration, custom video style and background music.


  
# Getting Started  
Below are the Instructions on setting up the project Locally.</br>
Also This Project uses the concept of Virtual Environments in Python so if you don't know how they work then refer to this [doc](
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)


## Prequisites 
Below are the Things you will need to use the software and How to install them :
- Operating System - Windows
- Python 3.11.5 Tested
- Pip 3 (Usually gets Installed with Python)
- FFMPEG - [Follow this Installation Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jx2_j5Seew)

if all the above prequisities are Satisfied, you may proceed to the next section.

## Installation
Follow these instructions to Setup your Own instance of the App :

</br>


### 1 : Clone the Repo 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/MambaCodes/BeAnonymous.git
```

### 2 : Cd to the folder
```sh
cd BeAnonymous
```

### 3 : Create & Activate a Python Virtual Environment
After you cd into the repo folder, ensure you see the following cmd/terminal prompt
```sh
Something.../BeAnonymous $
```

If not, repeat the previous step.

After this, run the following command in cmd/terminal:
```sh
python -m venv myenv
```

once your Virtual Environment is Created, Activate it using the following command in cmd/terminal:
```sh
myenv/Scripts/activate
```

### 4 : Install the PIP packages/dependencies
Once your Virtual Environment is setup, your Terminal should look like this :
```sh
  (myenv) Something...\BeAnonymous>
```
otherwise follow the previous step again.

After this, run the following command in cmd/terminal:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5 : It's done üéâ | Run the app
```bash
  (name_of_env) Something...\BeAnonymous>python main.py
```
</br>
And Congrats üéâ the Application would start if you have followed each step correctly.
