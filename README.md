 ##  Introduction
A simple template based video generator project written in Python. The project can be used to create videos like those of the popular group "Anonymous". We have a built-in video script editor to create your own custom video, which will be played on the screen. The works on various Python Libraries and Audio Post Processors like FFMPEG

### InShort
It is an Anonymous Video Generator with which you can Build viral and shareable videos, complete with audio narration, custom video style and background music.


  
# Getting Started  
Below are the Instructions on setting up the project Locally.</br>
Also This Project uses the concept of Virtual Environments in Python so if you don't know how they work then refer to this [doc](
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)


## Prequisites 
Below are the Things you will need to use the software and How to install them :
- Operating System - Windows
- Python 3.9.x ( 3.9.7 Tested )
- Pip 3 (Usually gets Installed with Python)
- FFMPEG - [[Refer Here]](https://github.com/MambaCodes/BeAnonymous/blob/main/src/ffmpeg/readme.md)

if all the above prequisities are Satisfied, you may proceedto the next section.

## Installation
Follow these instructions to Setup your Own instance of the App :

</br>


### 1 : Clone the Repo 
Find instructions for [cloning/downloading this repo here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository), then unzip the repository

</br>

### 2 : Cd to the folder

Open terminal/cmd/powershell and change directory/folder to the cloned folder. [Here are the instructions](https://www.howtogeek.com/659411/how-to-change-directories-in-command-prompt-on-windows-10/)

</br>


### 3 : Create & Activate a Python Virtual Environment
After you cd into the repo folder, ensure you see the following cmd/terminal prompt

```sh
Something.../BeAnonymous $
```

If not, repeat the previous step.

After this, run the following command in cmd/terminal:
```sh
python -m venv name_of_env
```

once your Virtual Environment is Created, Activate it using the following command in cmd/terminal:
```sh
name_of_env/Scripts/activate.bat
```

</br>

### 4 : Install the PIP packages/dependencies
Once your Virtual Environment is setup, your Terminal should look like this :
```sh
  (name_of_env) Something...\BeAnonymous>
```
otherwise follow the previous step again.

After this, run the following command in cmd/terminal:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

</br>

### 5 : It's done üéâ | Run the app
Open Root folder with cmd/terminal and activate Virtual Environment in it, now open `app.py` using python 3.
your terminal should look something like this :
```bash
  (name_of_env) Something...\BeAnonymous>python "src/app.py"
```
</br>
And Congrats üéâ the Application would start if you have followed each step correctly.
